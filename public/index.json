Although previously hampered by large sample-size requirements, recent methodological advances have made the paleoceanographic application of Δ47 on small (47 calibrations based on synthetic carbonate and various species of planktonic foraminifers. However, studies performed before recent methodological advances were based on relatively few species and data treatment that is now outdated. To overcome these limitations and elucidate species-specific effects, we analyzed 14 species of planktonic foraminifers in sediment surface samples from 13 sites, covering a growth temperature range of ∼0-28 °C. We selected mixed layer-dwelling and deep-dwelling species from a wide range of ocean settings to evaluate the feasibility of temperature reconstructions for different water depths. Various techniques to estimate foraminifer calcification temperatures were tested in order to assess their effects on the calibration and to find the most suitable approach. Results from this study generally confirm previous findings that there are no species-specific effects on the Δ47-temperature relationship in planktonic foraminifers, with one possible exception. Various morphotypes of *Globigerinoides ruber* were found to often deviate from the general trend determined for planktonic foraminifers. Our data are in excellent agreement with a recent foraminifer calibration study that was performed with a different analytical setup, as well as with a calibration based exclusively on benthic foraminifers. A combined, methodologically homogenized dataset also reveals very good agreement with an inorganic calibration based on travertines. Our findings highlight the potential of the Δ47 paleothermometer to be applied to recent and extinct species alike to study surface ocean temperatures as well as thermocline variability for a multitude of settings and time scales.","tags":[],"title":"A robust calibration of the clumped isotopes to temperature relationship for foraminifers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kristian A.

Key features include:\n Integration with UncertainData.jl, which makes handling uncertainties in your causality analyses a breeze.\n Integration with DynamicalSystems.jl, which allows the causality statistics to be applied to dynamical systems.\n Library of coupled dynamical systems for testing algorithm performance.\n  For more information, see the package documentation.\nA brief tutorial Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of how to use some of the functionality in the CausalityTools.jl package.

About the prediction lags The prediction lags in the predictive causality test must consist of n negative integers and n positive integers that are symmetric around zero.\nIn other words, negative lags must exactly match the positive lags but with opposite sign. The zero lag can be included, but will be ignored, so it is possible to give ranges too.\nExamples test_visitfreq = VisitationFrequencyTest(ηs = [-5, -4, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5]) test_transferoperator = TransferOperatorGridTest(ηs = -3:3) # Note that `predictive_test` is a *mandatory* keyword. PredictiveAsymmetryTest(predictive_test = test_visitfreq) PredictiveAsymmetryTest(predictive_test = test_transferoperator)  A Transfer entropy test Okay, so we first need to define a transfer entropy test to use for the prediction. For this, we have several choices, but for the demonstration, we\u0026rsquo;ll stick to the TransferOperatorGridTest, which estimates probabilities from an approximation to the transfer operator Diego et al., 2019.\n?TransferOperatorGridTest  search:TransferOperatorGridTest TransferOperatorGrid \nTransferOperatorGridTest(k::Int = 1, l::Int = 1, m::Int = 1, n::Int = 1, τ::Int = 1, b = 2, estimator::TransferOperatorGrid = TransferOperatorGrid(), binning_summary_statistic::Function = StatsBase.mean, binning::RectangularBinning, ηs)\nThe parameters for a transfer entropy test using the TransferOperatorGrid estimator.\nMandatory keyword arguments  binning::RectangularBinning: An instance of a RectangularBinning that dictates how the delay embedding is discretized. ηs: The prediction lags (that gos into the $T_{f}$ component of the embedding).  Optional keyword arguments  k::Int: The dimension of the $T_{f}$ component of the embedding. l::Int: The dimension of the $T_{pp}$ component of the embedding. m::Int: The dimension of the $S_{pp}$ component of the embedding. n::Int: The dimension of the $C_{pp}$ component of the embedding. τ::Int: The embedding lag. Default is τ = 1. b: Base of the logarithm. The default (b = 2) gives the TE in bits. estimator::TransferOperatorGrid: A TransferOperatorGrid estimator instance. binning_summary_statistic::Function: A summary statistic to summarise the transfer entropy values if multiple binnings are provided.  Estimation of the invariant measure With a TransferOperatorGridTest, the first step is to compute an approximation to the transfer operator over the partition elements of a rectangular discretization of an appropriate delay reconstruction of the time series to be analysed. Transfer entropy is then computed from the invariant distribution arising from the transfer operator.\nAbout the delay reconstruction for transfer entropy analysis Denote the time series for the source process $S$ as $S(t)$, and the time series for the target process $T$ as $T(t)$, and $C_i(t)$ as the time series for any conditional processes $C_i$ that also may influence $T$. To compute (conditional) TE, we need a generalised embedding incorporating all of these processes.\nFor convenience, define the state vectors\n$$ \\begin{align} T_f^{(k)} \u0026amp;= {(T(t+\\eta_k), \\ldots, T(t+\\eta_2), T(t+\\eta_1))}, \\newline T_{pp}^{(l)} \u0026amp;= { (T(t), T(t-\\tau_1), T(t-\\tau_2), \\ldots, T(t - \\tau_{l - 1}))}, \\newline S_{pp}^{(m)} \u0026amp;= {(S(t), S(t-\\tau_1), S(t-\\tau_2), \\ldots, S(t-\\tau_{m - 1}))},\\newline C_{pp}^{(n)} \u0026amp;= { (C_1(t), C_1(t-\\tau_1), \\ldots, C_2(t), C_2(t-\\tau_1) }, \\end{align} $$\nwhere the state vectors $T_f^{(k)}$ contain $k$ future values of the target variable, $T_{pp}^{(l)}$ contain $l$ present and past values of the target variable, $S_{pp}^{(m)}$ contain $m$ present and past values of the source variable, $C_{pp}^{(n)}$ contain a total of $n$ present and past values of any conditional variable(s). Combining all variables, we have the generalised embedding\n$$ \\begin{align} \\mathbb{E} = (T_f^{(k)}, T_{pp}^{(l)}, S_{pp}^{(m)}, C_{pp}^{(n)}) \\end{align} $$\nwith a total embedding dimension of $k + l + m + n$. Here, $\\tau$ indicates the embedding lag (in the VisitationFrequencyTest, we set $\\tau_1 = \\tau_2 = \\tau_3 = \\ldots$), and $\\eta$ indicates the prediction lag (the lag of the influence the source has on the target).\nHence, in the generalised embedding, only $T_f$ depends on the prediction lag $\\eta$, which is to be determined by the analyst. For transfer entropy analysis, $\\eta$ is chosen to be some positive integer, while for predictive asymmetry analysis, symmetric negative and positive $\\eta$s are used for computing $\\mathbb{A}$.\nIn terms of this generalised embedding, transfer entropy from a source variable $S$ to a target variable $T$ with conditioning on variable(s) $C$ is thus defined as\n$$ \\begin{align} TE_{S \\rightarrow T|C} = \\int_{\\mathbb{E}} P(T_f, T_{pp}, S_{pp}, C_{pp}) \\log_{2}{\\left( \\frac{P(T_f | T_{pp}, S_{pp}, C_{pp})}{P(T_f | T_{pp}, C_{pp})}\\right)} \\end{align} $$\nWithout conditioning, we have\n$$ \\begin{align} TE_{S \\rightarrow T} = \\int_{\\mathbb{E}} P(T_f, T_{pp}, S_{pp}) \\log_{2}{\\left(\\frac{P(T_f | T_{pp}, S_{pp})}{P(T_f | T_{pp})}\\right)} \\end{align} $$\nLow-level estimator This test uses the TransferOperatorGrid estimator on the following low-level method under the hood.\n transferentropy(::Any, ::TEVars, ::RectangularBinning, ::TransferEntropyEstimator)  In this estimator, the mapping between variables of the generalised embedding and the marginals during transfer entropy computation is controlled using a TEVars instance. It is highly recommended that you check the documentation for this method, because it describes the transfer entropy estimation procedure in detail.\nNotes:  Use causality(source, target, params::TransferOperatorGridTest) for regular transfer entropy analysis. This method uses only the k, l, m and ignores n when constructing the delay reconstruction. Use causality(source, target, cond, params::TransferOperatorGridTest) for conditional transfer entropy analysis. This method uses the k, l, m and n when constructing the delay reconstruction.

To compute the predictive asymmetry, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the transfer operator grid (Diego et al., 2019) transfer entropy test. To understand the parameters of the test, we need some background on transfer entropy:\nTransfer entropy Let\u0026rsquo;s say we have a source time series $S$ and a target time series $T$. For convenience, define\n$$\\begin{align} T_f^{(k)} \u0026amp;= {(T(t+\\eta_k), \\ldots, T(t+\\eta_2), T(t+\\eta_1))} \\newline T_{pp}^{(l)} \u0026amp;= { (T(t), T(t-\\tau_1), T(t-\\tau_2), \\ldots, T(t - \\tau_{l - 1}))} \\newline\nS_{pp}^{(m)} \u0026amp;= {(S(t), S(t-\\tau_1), S(t-\\tau_2), \\ldots, S(t-\\tau_{m - 1}))} \\end{align}$$\nCombining into a generalised delay reconstruction:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\mathbb{E} = (T_f^{(k)}, T_{pp}^{(l)}, S_{pp}^{(m)}) \\end{align} $$\nWith that, we have an embedding that we can use to compute transfer entropy:\n$$ \\begin{align} TE_{S \\rightarrow T} = \\int_{\\mathbb{E}} P(T_f, T_{pp}, S_{pp}) \\log_{2}{\\left(\\frac{P(T_f | T_{pp}, S_{pp})}{P(T_f | T_{pp})}\\right)} \\end{align} $$.\nDeciding on test parameters To organise our test, we can create an instance of a TransferOperatorGridTest, which has the following signature:\nTransferOperatorGridTest(k::Int = 1, l::Int = 1, m::Int = 1, n::Int = 1, τ::Int = 1, b = 2, estimator::TransferOperatorGrid = TransferOperatorGrid(), binning_summary_statistic::Function = StatsBase.mean, binning::RectangularBinning, ηs)  To get the full documentation, type ?TransferOperatorGridTest.\nParameter list What\u0026rsquo;s important for us are\n k, l, and m, which dictate the dimension of the delay reconstruction. The binning, which is a RectangularBinning instance. ηs is/are the prediction lag(s). b is the base of the logarithm. The τ parameter is the reconstruction delay, which only matters for k + l + m \u0026gt; 3.  With that in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s set up a very simple test.\n# Use a three-dimensional delay reconstruction k, l, m = 1, 1, 1 # Use a rectangular partition where the number of bin elements scale # with the number of points (following Krakovska et al., 2018). n_subdivisions = floor(Int, npts^(1/(k+l+m+1))) binning = RectangularBinning(n_subdivisions) # Compute the predictive asymmetry for η ranging from -8 to 8. ηs = -8:8 te_test = TransferOperatorGridTest(k = k, l = l, m = m, binning = binning, ηs = ηs)  TransferOperatorGridTest(k = 1, l = 1, m = 1, n = 1, τ = 1, b = 2, estimator = TransferOperatorGrid(), binning_summary_statistic = mean, binning = RectangularBinning(4), ηs = -8:8) \nNow, we can use this transfer entropy test as input to a PredictiveAsymmetryTest instance.\npa_test = PredictiveAsymmetryTest(predictive_test = te_test)  PredictiveAsymmetryTest{TransferOperatorGridTest}(predictive_test = TransferOperatorGridTest(k = 1, l = 1, m = 1, n = 1, τ = 1, b = 2, estimator = TransferOperatorGrid(), binning_summary_statistic = mean, binning = RectangularBinning(4), ηs = -8:8)) \nApplying the test pa_xy = causality(x, y, pa_test) pa_yx = causality(y, x, pa_test) pa_yz = causality(y, z, pa_test) pa_zy = causality(z, y, pa_test) pa_xz = causality(x, z, pa_test) pa_zx = causality(z, x, pa_test);  p_xy = plot(xlabel = \u0026quot;Prediction lag\u0026quot;, ylabel = L\u0026quot;\\mathbb{A} (bits)\u0026quot;, ylims = [-0.8, 0.8]) plot!(1:maximum(ηs), pa_xy, label = L\u0026quot;x \\to y\u0026quot;, c = :black) plot!(1:maximum(ηs), pa_yx, label = L\u0026quot;y \\to x\u0026quot;, c = :red) hline!([0], lw = 2, ls = :dot, α = 0.5, c = :black, label = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) p_yz = plot(xlabel = \u0026quot;Prediction lag\u0026quot;, ylabel = L\u0026quot;\\mathbb{A} (bits)\u0026quot;, ylims = [-0.8, 0.8]) plot!(1:maximum(ηs), pa_yz, label = L\u0026quot;y \\to z\u0026quot;, c = :red) plot!(1:maximum(ηs), pa_zy, label = L\u0026quot;z \\to y\u0026quot;, c = :blue) hline!([0], lw = 2, ls = :dot, α = 0.5, c = :black, label = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) p_xz = plot(xlabel = \u0026quot;Prediction lag\u0026quot;, ylabel = L\u0026quot;\\mathbb{A} (bits)\u0026quot;, ylims = [-0.8, 0.8]) plot!(1:maximum(ηs), pa_xz, label = L\u0026quot;x \\to z\u0026quot;, c = :black) plot!(1:maximum(ηs), pa_zx, label = L\u0026quot;z \\to x\u0026quot;, c = :blue) hline!([0], lw = 2, ls = :dot, α = 0.5, c = :black, label = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) plot(p_xy, p_yz, p_xz, layout = grid(3, 1), size = (600, 600), legend = :topleft)  The direct influences $\\mathbb{A}_{x \\to y}$ and $\\mathbb{A}_{y \\to z}$ are both positive and of equal strength, while the indirect influence $\\mathbb{A}_{x \\to z}$ is weaker. In the non-causal direction, $\\mathbb{A}_{y \\to x}$, $\\mathbb{A}_{z \\to y}$ and $\\mathbb{A}_{z \\to x}$ are all negative.

There is mounting evidence of advances that predate the Little Ice Age (1250-1850 CE); this challenges the view that 13th century volcanic eruptions triggered change by spurring sea-ice expansion. Recent climate model simulations indicate this response does not require external forcing under contemporaneous (Pre-Industrial) boundary conditions. Here, we try to reconcile these new insights by combining regional proxy evidence of glacier and sea-ice change with a climate model experiment. Collated recently published reconstructions demonstrate that regional climate shifted towards a colder mean state around 650-950 CE, a period marked by low radiative forcing. Unforced model simulations reproduce the time-transgressive evolution of this response, which emerged east of Greenland and progressed towards Svalbard. The inferred pattern is associated with sea-ice feedbacks, triggered by stochastic atmospheric cooling. We argue that this mechanism may explain the timing and pattern of CE glacier growth in the region.","tags":[],"title":"Was Common Era glacier expansion in the Arctic Atlantic region triggered by unforced atmospheric cooling?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eichenseer K","Balthasar U","Smart CW","Stander J","Haaga KA","Kiessling W"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.   -- ","date":1561932000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561932000,"objectID":"11a8e77ff9dd87eed5ddd2c357083d01","permalink":"https://www.earthsystemevolution.com/publication/eichenseer_et_al_2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/eichenseer_et_al_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Secular changes of ocean chemistry and temperature governs the ecological success of aragonitic calcifiers from the Ordovician to the Middle Jurassic, but not thereafter.

While requiring larger sample sizes than most other proxies, the clumped isotope method is independent of seawater chemistry. Here we test if small benthic foraminifera precipitate their carbonate in equilibrium with respect to the clumped isotope thermometer and if there are any species‐specific vital effects. We find that benthic foraminifera fall on the same calibration line as the majority of carbonate minerals including inorganic calcite. In addition, we find no offsets that can be attributed to a species‐specific for any of the samples. This finding implies that a necessary amount of sample material can be obtained by aggregating over multiple taxa of benthic foraminifera and allows for the application of this proxy over major climatic transitions that coincide with seawater chemistry changes and foraminifera extinctions.","tags":[],"title":"Application of Clumped Isotope Thermometry to Benthic Foraminifera","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego D","Haaga KA","Hannisdal B"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.   -- ","date":1555624800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555624800,"objectID":"134b676332c1ad60d0fa2e6902ffa89d","permalink":"https://www.earthsystemevolution.com/publication/diego_et_al_2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-19T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/diego_et_al_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We compute transfer entropy by estimating the invariant measure from the invariant distribution of the transfer operator approximated from time series.

Combining these data with previous studies, we construct a relative sea‐level(RSL) curve from 18k cal a BP until the present, which is ~3 ka longer than any previous RSL reconstruction from southern Norway. Following deglaciation, southern Karmøy has experienced a net emergence of around 16–19 m, although with significant RSL fluctuations. This includes two RSL minima well below present MSL around ~13.8 and ~10k cal aBP, and two maxima that culminated around 5–7 m above MSL during the Younger Dryas and early to mid‐Holocene, respectively. Considering eustatic sea level and modelled gravitational deformation of the geoid, we estimate a net postglacial isostatic uplift of ~120 m.","tags":[],"title":"Evidence of early deglaciation (18 000 cal a BP) and a postglacial relative sea‐level curve from southern Karmøy, south‐west Norway","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haaga KA","Diego D","Hannisdal B"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.   -- ","date":1549494000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549494000,"objectID":"7e7e77fc00faa824a5ac930a928f6cea","permalink":"https://www.earthsystemevolution.com/publication/haaga_et_al_surrogates/","publishdate":"2019-02-07T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/haaga_et_al_surrogates/","section":"publication","summary":"We present two new methods for generating uni- and multivariate surrogate data derived from transfer operator approximation.
