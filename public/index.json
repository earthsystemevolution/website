Although previously hampered by large sample-size requirements, recent methodological advances have made the paleoceanographic application of Œî47 on small (47 calibrations based on synthetic carbonate and various species of planktonic foraminifers. However, studies performed before recent methodological advances were based on relatively few species and data treatment that is now outdated. To overcome these limitations and elucidate species-specific effects, we analyzed 14 species of planktonic foraminifers in sediment surface samples from 13 sites, covering a growth temperature range of ‚àº0-28 ¬∞C. We selected mixed layer-dwelling and deep-dwelling species from a wide range of ocean settings to evaluate the feasibility of temperature reconstructions for different water depths. Various techniques to estimate foraminifer calcification temperatures were tested in order to assess their effects on the calibration and to find the most suitable approach. Results from this study generally confirm previous findings that there are no species-specific effects on the Œî47-temperature relationship in planktonic foraminifers, with one possible exception. Various morphotypes of *Globigerinoides ruber* were found to often deviate from the general trend determined for planktonic foraminifers. Our data are in excellent agreement with a recent foraminifer calibration study that was performed with a different analytical setup, as well as with a calibration based exclusively on benthic foraminifers. A combined, methodologically homogenized dataset also reveals very good agreement with an inorganic calibration based on travertines. Our findings highlight the potential of the Œî47 paleothermometer to be applied to recent and extinct species alike to study surface ocean temperatures as well as thermocline variability for a multitude of settings and time scales.","tags":[],"title":"A robust calibration of the clumped isotopes to temperature relationship for foraminifers","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A brief tutorial Here‚Äôs an example of some of the functionality in the CausalityTools.jl package, which provides algorithms for characterizing dynamical coupling and causal interactions from time series data.

The example was made in a JupyterLab notebook using a Julia 1.6.0 kernel and CausalityTools.jl version 1.2.0.\nPlease see the package documentation for more details.\n We first create a dedicated folder and start by activating a Julia project in that folder:\nusing Pkg Pkg.activate(\u0026#34;./\u0026#34;)  Then we add the required packages to the project:\nPkg.add([\u0026#34;CausalityTools\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Plots\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;LaTeXStrings\u0026#34;])  Now we are ready to load the modules we need for this example:\nusing CausalityTools, Plots, LaTeXStrings  Generating time series from a dynamical system CausalityTools.jl provides a range of different example systems as built-in functions. As an example, let‚Äôs choose a discrete dynamical system composed of two coupled logistic maps where $x$ unidirectionally influences $y$, using the function logistic2_unidir, which takes the following arguments:\n $u_0$, a two-element vector specifying the initial states of $x$ and $y$ $c_{xy}$, a scalar controlling the strength of the influence of $x$ on $y$ $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are the model parameters, which by default are set to values yielding chaotic behaviour $\\sigma$ is a scalar on $[0, 1]$ controlling the level of dynamical noise  For more details on this system, see Example systems in the documentation.\nsystem = logistic2_unidir(u‚ÇÄ = rand(2), c_xy = 0.5, r‚ÇÅ = 3.78, r‚ÇÇ = 3.66, œÉ = 0.05)  Now we can generate an orbit (a collection of points following the evolution function of the system) and extract time series for the $x$ and $y$ components:\nnpts = 300 # number of points in the time series Ttr = 1000 # how many transient points to skip orbit = trajectory(system, npts, Ttr = Ttr) x = orbit[:, 1] y = orbit[:, 2] # set some nice plot font defaults default(fontfamily=\u0026#34;Computer Modern\u0026#34;, yguidefontsize = 12, ytickfontsize = 8, xguidefontsize = 12, xtickfontsize = 8, legendfontsize = 12) px = plot(0:npts, x, c = :black) py = plot(0:npts, y, c = :red) plot(px, py, layout = grid(2,1), link = :all, legend = false, xlabel =[\u0026#34;\u0026#34; L\u0026#34;t\u0026#34;], ylabel = [L\u0026#34;x(t)\u0026#34; L\u0026#34;y(t)\u0026#34;], size = (600, 400))      Now we can try to recover the unidirectional causal relationship $x \\to y$ by computing causality statistics directly from the time series data. CausalityTools.jl provides a range of different methods, both distance-based and entropy-based. Here we will shamelessly plug an information-theoretic method proposed by Haaga et al., called Predictive Asymmetry.

Furthermore, we expect the predictive asymmetry to converge towards zero with increasing prediction lag in a system-dependent manner, as the influence of the driver on the response variable diminishes.\nIn our example of two chaotic logistic maps unidirectionally coupled $x \\to y$, we find that $\\mathbb{A}_{x \\to y} \u0026gt; 0$ and $\\mathbb{A}_{y \\to x} \u0026lt; 0$, which indicates a unidirectional causal relationships $x \\to y$.\nBut what happens if the causal relationship goes both ways?\nBidirectional causality We can use the function logistic2_bidir to generate bidirectionally coupled logistic maps.

Haaga for handling data with associated uncertainties and datasets consisting of uncertain values. These uncertain data values are stored in the form of probability distributions or populations. Computational data analyses are performed by resampling the distributions furnishing the uncertain values. For more details, please see the documentation.\nThis example was made in a JupyterLab notebook using a Julia 1.6.0 kernel, UncertainData.jl version 0.16.0 and CausalityTools.jl version 1.2.0.\n We first create a dedicated folder and start by activating a Julia project in that folder:\nusing Pkg Pkg.activate(\u0026#34;./\u0026#34;)  Then we add the required packages to the project:\nPkg.add([\u0026#34;UncertainData\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;CausalityTools\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Distributions\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Plots\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;LaTeXStrings\u0026#34;])  Now we are ready to load the modules we need for this example:\nusing UncertainData, CausalityTools, Distributions, Plots, LaTeXStrings  Time series with uncertainty The UncertainData.jl package is primarily intended for use with real-world data, but here we generate synthetic data using one of the example systems available as built-in functions in CausalityTools.jl Let‚Äôs choose a stochastic dynamical system consisting of two first-order autoregressive (AR1) processes unidirectionally coupled $x \\to y$. We use the function ar1_unidir, which takes the following arguments:\n $u_0$, a two-element vector specifying the initial states of $x$ and $y$ $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are the model parameters $c_{xy}$, a scalar controlling the strength of the influence of $x$ on $y$ $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the noise terms  For more details on this system, see Example systems in the documentation.\nsystem = ar1_unidir(u‚ÇÄ = rand(2), a‚ÇÅ = 0.90693, b‚ÇÅ = 0.40693, c_xy = 0.5, œÉ = 0.40662)  Now we can generate time series from this system and then add uncertainty both to the values and to the time indices. The latter is relevant for data such as paleoclimate proxies with geochronological (e.g. radiocarbon dating) uncertainty.\nFor this we can use the convenience function example_uncertain_indexvalue_dataset from the UncertainData.jl package. This function generates a pair of UncertainIndexValueDatasets from a discrete dynamical system by iterating the system npts times after a transient run of tstep steps, then it gathers two variables defined by column indices vars as time series x and y.\nThese time series are then converted to uncertain data by replacing each value with a probability distribution, in this case a normal distribution defined by a mean (the original value) and a standard deviation (user defined). Hence, x[i] and y[i] are replaced with UncertainValue(Normal, x[i], d_xval) and UncertainValue(Normal, y[i], d_yval), respectively. The time indices for x and y are also replaced with normal distributions, such that x_inds[i] = UncertainValue(Normal, i, d_xind), and y_inds[i] = UncertainValue(Normal, i, d_yind).\nThe function returns a tuple of UncertainIndexValueDataset instances, one for x and one for y.\nvars = (1, 2) npts, tstep = 100, 10 # Let\u0026#39;s draw random values for the std. devs. d_xind, d_yind = Uniform(2.5, 15.5), Uniform(2.5, 15.5) d_xval, d_yval = Uniform(0.01, 0.2), Uniform(0.01, 0.2) x, y = example_uncertain_indexvalue_datasets(system, npts, vars, tstep = tstep, d_xind = d_xind, d_yind = d_yind, d_xval = d_xval, d_yval = d_yval) # set some nice plot font defaults default(fontfamily=\u0026#34;Computer Modern\u0026#34;, yguidefontsize = 12, ytickfontsize = 8, xguidefontsize = 12, xtickfontsize = 8, legendfontsize = 12) qs = [0.025, 0.975] # quantile range for error bars px = plot(x, qs, qs, ms = 3, c = :black, marker = stroke(0.01, :black)) py = plot(y, qs, qs, ms = 3, c = :red, marker = stroke(0.01, :red)) plot(px, py, layout = grid(2,1), link = :all, legend = false, xlabel =[\u0026#34;\u0026#34; L\u0026#34;t\u0026#34;], ylabel = [L\u0026#34;x(t)\u0026#34; L\u0026#34;y(t)\u0026#34;], size = (800, 600))     These time series have variable uncertainties on their time indices, hence they are not on a regularly spaced grid. This irregularity can create problems for many time series analysis methods, including lag-based causality estimators. One solution is to resample the data on a regular time grid. Let‚Äôs choose a grid where the left bin edges range from 0 to 1000 in steps of 10, which would look like this:\ntgrid = 0:10:1000 plot(px, py, layout = grid(2,1), link = :all, legend = false, xlabel =[\u0026#34;\u0026#34; L\u0026#34;t\u0026#34;], ylabel = [L\u0026#34;x(t)\u0026#34; L\u0026#34;y(t)\u0026#34;], size = (800, 600)) vline!([tgrid tgrid] |\u0026gt; collect, c = :grey, lw = .5)     Now we can use BinnedResampling to resample within the uncertainties in each bin, keeping track of all draws falling in a particular bin. Uncertainty distributions in a bin are then estimated by a kernel density estimate over the draws falling in that bin.\nHere we‚Äôll sample each point in the dataset 1000 times, yielding a total of 100 $\\times$ 1000 draws from which the distributions are estimated.\nresampling = BinnedResampling(tgrid, 1000) x_binned = resample(x, resampling) ‚Ä¶","date":1573430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641513600,"objectID":"14b54c992e38ea9c22f53ae369f3b402","permalink":"https://www.earthsystemevolution.com/project/uncertaindata/","publishdate":"2019-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/uncertaindata/","section":"project","summary":"A Julia package for working with uncertain values and datasets.","tags":null,"title":"Uncertain Data","type":"project"},{"authors":["Haaga KA"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"35d408f8796f4ef9fc279928d14393f1","permalink":"https://www.earthsystemevolution.com/publication/haaga_2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haaga_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"UncertainData.jl provides an interface to represent data with associated uncertainties for the Julia programming language, using a resampling approach to deal with uncertainties in calculations.","tags":[],"title":"UncertainData.jl: a Julia package for working with measurements and datasets with uncertainties","type":"publication"},{"authors":["van der Bilt WGM","Born A","Haaga KA"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571097600,"objectID":"83179ece1156de2361d0acb3499a10c0","permalink":"https://www.earthsystemevolution.com/publication/vanderbilt_et_al_2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vanderbilt_et_al_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The timing and causes of Common Era (CE) glacier growth in the Arctic Atlantic region remain elusive. There is mounting evidence of advances that predate the Little Ice Age (1250-1850 CE); this challenges the view that 13th century volcanic eruptions triggered change by spurring sea-ice expansion. Recent climate model simulations indicate this response does not require external forcing under contemporaneous (Pre-Industrial) boundary conditions. Here, we try to reconcile these new insights by combining regional proxy evidence of glacier and sea-ice change with a climate model experiment. Collated recently published reconstructions demonstrate that regional climate shifted towards a colder mean state around 650-¬Ä¬ì950 CE, a period marked by low radiative forcing. Unforced model simulations reproduce the time-transgressive evolution of this response, which emerged east of Greenland and progressed towards Svalbard. The inferred pattern is associated with sea-ice feedbacks, triggered by stochastic atmospheric cooling. We argue that this mechanism may explain the timing and pattern of CE glacier growth in the region.","tags":[],"title":"Was Common Era glacier expansion in the Arctic Atlantic region triggered by unforced atmospheric cooling?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eichenseer K","Balthasar U","Smart CW","Stander J","Haaga KA","Kiessling W"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"11a8e77ff9dd87eed5ddd2c357083d01","permalink":"https://www.earthsystemevolution.com/publication/eichenseer_et_al_2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/eichenseer_et_al_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Secular changes of ocean chemistry and temperature governs the ecological success of aragonitic calcifiers from the Ordovician to the Middle Jurassic, but not thereafter.

Seawater salinity, carbonate ion concentration, Œ¥18O, and elemental abundance changes may obscure widely applied paleoproxies. In addition, with foraminifera‚Äêbased proxies applied over long time scales or through major transitions, taxonomic turnover can impair the robustness of a record. While requiring larger sample sizes than most other proxies, the clumped isotope method is independent of seawater chemistry. Here we test if small benthic foraminifera precipitate their carbonate in equilibrium with respect to the clumped isotope thermometer and if there are any species‚Äêspecific vital effects. We find that benthic foraminifera fall on the same calibration line as the majority of carbonate minerals including inorganic calcite. In addition, we find no offsets that can be attributed to a species‚Äêspecific for any of the samples. This finding implies that a necessary amount of sample material can be obtained by aggregating over multiple taxa of benthic foraminifera and allows for the application of this proxy over major climatic transitions that coincide with seawater chemistry changes and foraminifera extinctions.","tags":[],"title":"Application of Clumped Isotope Thermometry to Benthic Foraminifera","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego D","Haaga KA","Hannisdal B"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555632000,"objectID":"134b676332c1ad60d0fa2e6902ffa89d","permalink":"https://www.earthsystemevolution.com/publication/diego_et_al_2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/diego_et_al_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We compute transfer entropy by estimating the invariant measure from the invariant distribution of the transfer operator approximated from time series.
