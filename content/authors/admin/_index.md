Bjarte Hannisdal is an Associate professor of Earth science at the University of Bergen. His research interests include Earth system history, quantitative paleo- and geobiology, and causality in dynamical systems. He leads the Earth System Evolution project, which develops novel methods for quantifying causal interactions from observations of natural systems, under the motto: *More can be learned by analysing old data in new ways than by analysing new data in old ways.*.
