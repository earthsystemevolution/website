Bjarte Hannisdal is an Associate professor of Earth science at the University of Bergen. His research interests include quantitative paleobiology and geobiology, Earth system history, and causality in dynamical systems. He leads the Earth System Evolution group, which develops novel methods for quantifying causal interactions from time series, with the aim of transforming the way geoscientists use observed geological records to study changes in Earth's past.
