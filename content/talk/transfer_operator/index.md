title: A new method for quantifying Earth system interactions from time series
event: K. G. Jebsen Centre for Deep Sea Research
event_url: https://www.uib.no/en/kgj-deepsea
location: Bergen, Norway
summary: A presentation of transfer entropy computation using the Perron-Frobenius operator.
abstract: "We present a method for computing the transfer entropy between time series using Ulamâ€™s approximation of the Perron-Frobenius (transfer) operator associated with the map generating the dynamics. Our method differs from standard transfer entropy estimators in that the invariant measure is estimated not directly from the data points but from the invariant distribution of the transfer operator approximated from the data points. We discuss the robustness of our method to sparse and noisy data, and assess its performance relative to other transfer entropy estimators."
