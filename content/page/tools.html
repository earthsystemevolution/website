<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>On this page, we will provide links to code repositories for different methods used in our projects. We also share some interactive software tools for generating time series from dynamical systems.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/kahaaga/tstools">Wrapper functions in R that simplify lagged CCM analyses with surrogate testing</a>. These functions accompany our study of the <a href="/publication/Haaga_et_al_2017/">forcing of Late Pleistocene ice volume by spatially variable summer energy</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>An interactive <a href="https://kahaaga.com/apps/daisyworld/">Daisyworld model</a> that can be used to generate time series of components of a coupled dynamical system involving external forcing and internal feedbacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Coming soon: a code repository of R functions running <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> under the hood for computing transfer entropy using our <a href="/project/information-invariants/">random permutation transfer entropy</a> method - stay tuned!</p></li>
